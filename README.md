# Week 4

## Introduction

Methods are a cornerstone of software development. They bring clarity to code. We focus on Classes this week in the exercises to demonstrate how we can create more cohesive objects that perform all the work that was previously spread across different methods.

### Outline

#### Topics

* Classes
* Initialize Methods
* Member variables
* Attribute Accessors
* Alias methods
* Class Methods

#### Exercise

* Fork and clone this repository
* Fix the tests on a branch
* Push your changes to Github on that branch

#### Reading

## Exercise

The exercise are laid out the same as last week.

* Fork and clone this repository
* Run Bundler
* Run the tests / Setup Guard
* Switch to the 'solutions' branch
* Write the classes in the file contained in the lib directory.
* Commit your changes to the 'solutions' branch
* Push your 'solutions' branch up to Github


### Working in the lib directory

Ruby has no requirement that the class within the file matches the name of the file. You are also not limited to having a single class within a file. However, it is a good convention to create a file for each class. This makes it easier to find the classes later as they will match to the filename.

The files in the `lib` directory have a test file counterpart within the `spec` directory. This is also a convention, though a more loosely enforced one. But it is often good practice to have the tests related to a class in a similarly named file.
